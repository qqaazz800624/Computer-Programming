# Computer Programming (C/C++)

This repository contains materials, examples, and exercises for the **C/C++ Programming Course**. C/C++ is a fundamental programming language and one of the most commonly used in various fields such as hardware design, firmware development, and system software. By mastering C/C++, you'll gain a deep understanding of how computers process information and develop essential programming skills.

C++ extends C with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, which are crucial in designing large-scale software. Learning OOP concepts through C++ will also make it easier to pick up other OOP-based languages like Java.

Furthermore, C/C++ is the foundation of the Arduino programming language, making it an excellent starting point for those interested in hardware programming and the Maker community.

## Course Format
This course will follow a **hybrid learning format**. Every week, there will be online lessons, followed by in-person discussions and Q&A sessions every other week. This structure will help maximize learning efficiency.
