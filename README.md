# C/C++ Programming 

This repository contains the learning materials and assignments for the C/C++ Programming Course. This course introduces students to the essential concepts of programming using C and C++. C/C++ is one of the most fundamental and widely used programming languages today, and mastering it will provide students with a solid foundation for software development, system design, and even hardware programming.

## Course Overview

C/C++ is the go-to language for system-level programming and has applications in a wide variety of fields, including firmware, hardware design, and large-scale software systems. C++ builds on the foundation of C by introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, which are crucial for the development of large and complex software projects. Learning C/C++ will also provide a smooth transition to other OOP languages, such as Java.

**Why learn C/C++?**
- **Versatility**: C/C++ is used across hardware, software, and embedded systems development.
- **Efficiency**: Learning the fundamentals of programming through C/C++ helps you understand how computers process information.
- **Foundation for OOP**: C++ offers modern OOP concepts that make software design and development more efficient.
- **Maker Applications**: C/C++ is the foundation of development for Arduino and other Maker tools, enhancing your ability to work on DIY electronics projects.

The course will be delivered in a hybrid format, with online sessions alternating with in-person discussions and problem-solving. This structure maximizes time efficiency and ensures that students have ample opportunity to apply the concepts learned.
